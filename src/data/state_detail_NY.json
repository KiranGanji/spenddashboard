  {
    "title": "Hospital outpatient pricing and site-of-care drift driving ~$1.0–1.6B",
    "detail": "New York spend is structurally elevated as outpatient procedures and infusions continue to shift into higher-cost hospital outpatient settings; reinforcing site-of-care routing and tightening outpatient reimbursement guardrails is the most direct lever to reduce forecast pressure."
  },
  {
    "title": "Downstate utilization hotspots deviating above statewide norm",
    "detail": "Downstate provider clusters show statistically significant unit-cost lift and utilization intensity in outpatient imaging and specialty services, inconsistent with morbidity changes—indicating behavioral spend that baseline forecasting models absorb as trend."
  },
  {
    "title": "Imaging and outpatient specialty edits losing effectiveness",
    "detail": "Denied NY claims in advanced imaging and outpatient specialty pathways (MRI/CT CPT families) repeatedly convert to paid through diagnosis reclassification and staged billing, weakening baseline denial yield; tightening exception logic and appeal thresholds will restore control."
  },
  {
    "title": "Concentration risk among large integrated systems",
    "detail": "A small number of large New York health systems account for an outsized share of outpatient specialty and infusion growth, amplifying state forecast variance; targeted engagement and enforcement with these systems yields disproportionate impact."
  },
  {
    "title": "Network spillover through shared billing operations and affiliations",
    "detail": "Providers connected through shared billing operations show highly correlated CPT sequencing and appeal success, creating spillover risk where effective tactics propagate across the state; cluster-level interventions reduce systemic exposure."
  },
  {
    "title": "Behavior-driven spend distorting NY trend assumptions",
    "detail": "After controlling for utilization and morbidity, $2–4B of New York projected spend appears attributable to controllable provider behavior in hospital outpatient migration, imaging, and denial leakage rather than organic clinical demand growth."
