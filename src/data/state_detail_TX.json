  {
    "title": "ASC-heavy outpatient surgery trend adding ~$1.2–1.8B",
    "detail": "Texas spend is elevated by high-volume outpatient surgery through ASCs where site-of-care routing and medical necessity controls are uneven; high-frequency ortho and GI procedures (e.g., CPT 27447, 29827, 43239) are key contributors—tightening ASC steerage and pre-pay edits will move the state number quickly."
  },
  {
    "title": "South Texas hotspot patterns deviating 10–20% above peers",
    "detail": "Provider clusters in specific South Texas markets show unit-cost lift 10–20% above statewide benchmarks across imaging, injections, and minor surgeries, inconsistent with member mix and acuity—indicating localized behavioral spend that baseline forecasts misread as medical inflation."
  },
  {
    "title": "High-cost drug and infusion controls bypassed in select corridors",
    "detail": "Specialty drug/infusion claims (oncology and immunology J-code families) show repeat paid patterns despite step-therapy and site-of-care intent, suggesting policy bypass via coding/setting selection; enforcing compliant settings and tightening supportive-care add-on logic are primary levers."
  },
  {
    "title": "Denial leakage via resubmission and modifier variation",
    "detail": "A repeatable subset of denied Texas claims convert to paid through resubmission pathways and modifier sequencing, raising realized paid rate beyond baseline assumptions; hardening edits on the top leakage pathways will reduce forecast uncertainty."
  },
  {
    "title": "Vendor-linked propagation risk across provider networks",
    "detail": "Shared RCM/EHR configurations correlate with mirrored CPT sequences and overturn rates, enabling rapid tactic reuse across Texas provider networks; intervening at the network level prevents spillover and stabilizes state forecasting."
  },
  {
    "title": "Material share of TX spend is controllable behavior",
    "detail": "When isolating utilization and morbidity effects, $3–5B of Texas projected spend appears driven by controllable provider and network behavior in outpatient surgery, imaging, and specialty drugs rather than true demand growth."
